## 1. 🧠 Core Concepts: What is BigQuery?

**Google BigQuery** is a fully managed, **serverless**, **petabyte-scale** data warehouse that runs lightning-fast SQL queries over massive datasets. "Serverless" means no infrastructure management—just load data and start querying.

### 🔧 Core Architecture: Separation of Storage and Compute

This is BigQuery's most fundamental concept:

- **Storage (Colossus)**: Google's distributed file system. Automatically handles replication, durability, and optimization.
- **Compute (Dremel)**: The execution engine. Spawns thousands of parallel workers (called *slots*) to process your query efficiently.

> 💡 **Key Benefit:** You store data cheaply and only pay for compute when running queries.

### 📚 Key Terminology

| Term      | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Project** | Top-level GCP container holding resources |
| **Dataset** | A container for tables, views, and UDFs (like a schema) |
| **Table** | A collection of rows and columns |
| **Job** | Any task (querying, loading, exporting) initiated in BigQuery |

## 2. 📥 Getting Data Into BigQuery

### ✅ Batch Loading from Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

Most common and cost-effective method for bulk data ingestion.

- **Use Case:** Daily/hourly ETL/ELT jobs
- **Formats Supported:** CSV, JSONL, Avro, Parquet, ORC
- **Pro Tip:** Prefer **Avro** or **Parquet** (binary, columnar, and self-describing)

#### 🖥️ Example: Load Parquet File via `bq` CLI

```bash
bq load \
  --source_format=PARQUET \
  --autodetect \
  'my-project:my_dataset.new_table' \
  'gs://my-bucket/data/users.parquet'
```

### 🔁 Streaming Inserts

For real-time ingestion using the `tabledata.insertAll` API.

- **Use Case:** Capturing live application events (clickstreams, logs)
- **Pros:** Data available within seconds
- **Cons:** More expensive than batch; not suitable for bulk loads

## 3. 🔍 Querying & Structuring Data

BigQuery uses **Google Standard SQL** (ANSI-compliant) and supports advanced constructs.

### 🔄 Handling Nested & Repeated Data (STRUCT & ARRAY)

BigQuery handles **semi-structured** data like a pro.

#### 📦 Example: Flatten an ARRAY of STRUCTs

```sql
SELECT
  transaction_id,
  item.item_name,
  item.price
FROM
  `my-project.my_dataset.transactions`,
  UNNEST(items) AS item
WHERE
  item.price > 100.00;
```

### 🪟 Window Functions for Analytics

Used for deduplication, ranking, and cumulative analysis.

#### Example: Get Most Recent Event Per User

```sql
WITH RankedEvents AS (
  SELECT
    user_id,
    event_name,
    event_timestamp,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY event_timestamp DESC) AS rn
  FROM
    `my-project.my_dataset.user_events`
)
SELECT
  user_id,
  event_name,
  event_timestamp
FROM
  RankedEvents
WHERE
  rn = 1;
```

### 🧩 Scripting, Stored Procedures & UDFs

- **Stored Procedures**: Procedural logic in SQL (IF, WHILE, etc.)
- **UDFs**: Write custom logic using SQL (preferred) or JavaScript

## 4. 💰 Performance & Cost Optimization

### 📆 Partitioning & 🔢 Clustering

| Technique     | Benefit |
|---------------|---------|
| **Partitioning** | Splits data for efficient scans by date/time columns |
| **Clustering**   | Sorts data within partitions for faster filtering |
| **Best Practice** | Partition by date, cluster by commonly filtered columns |

### 🧪 Table Clones & Snapshots

- **Snapshot**: Point-in-time, read-only copy
- **Clone**: Point-in-time, read-write copy
- **Cost-Efficiency**: Only pay for changes; ideal for dev/testing

## 5. 🏛️ Advanced Topics for Senior Engineers

### 🏗️ Advanced Data Modeling & Architecture

- **Materialized Views**: Cached, precomputed query results
- **External Tables**: Query raw files from GCS/S3/Azure
- **BI Engine**: In-memory cache for BI tools
- **Reservations/Slots**: Dedicated compute capacity for teams

### 🔐 Governance & Security

- **Row-Level Security**: Filters rows based on user identity
- **Column Security & Masking**: Restrict or obfuscate sensitive fields
- **Data Catalog / Dataplex**: Metadata, lineage, quality, and discovery

### 🛠️ Operational Excellence

- **Query Plan Debugging**: Look for SHUFFLE stages and bottlenecks
- **CI/CD**: Use Terraform, dbt, Git for schema/view/version control
- **Event-Driven Pipelines**: GCS + Cloud Functions + BigQuery load jobs
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Use Cloud Composer (Airflow)

## 6. 🎙️ Interview Questions & Answers

### 🔹 Foundational Concepts

**Q1:** What is the main architectural difference between BigQuery and a traditional database?  
**A:** Separation of compute (Dremel) and storage (Colossus).

**Q2:** Explain BigQuery's two pricing models.  
**A:** On-Demand (pay per byte scanned) vs Flat-Rate (dedicated slots).

---

### 🔹 Practical Querying & Data Handling

**Q3:** How would you deduplicate records with duplicate `event_ids`?  
**A:** Use `ROW_NUMBER()` with partition by `event_id` and filter where `ROW_NUMBER() = 1`.

**Q4:** When use a Stored Procedure over Cloud Composer?  
**A:** When logic is fully SQL-based without external dependencies.

---

### 🔹 Optimization & Cost Management

**Q5:** Partitioning vs Clustering?  
**A:** Partition reduces scanned partitions; clustering optimizes filtering inside partitions.

**Q6:** How to clone a 10TB prod table for dev quickly?  
**A:** Use a **Table Clone**—instant, metadata-only, only charges for changes.

---

### 🔹 Architecture & Design (Senior Level)

**Q7:** How to speed up a slow BI dashboard?  
**A:** Use **Materialized Views** or **BI Engine**—or both.

**Q8:** Next step after applying partitioning but query still slow?  
**A:** Analyze **Query Execution Plan** for SHUFFLE-heavy stages.

**Q9:** Describe event-driven ingestion from GCS to BigQuery.  
**A:** GCS Trigger → Cloud Function → BigQuery Load Job

**Q10:** How to help analysts discover and trust datasets?  
**A:** Use **Data Catalog** for metadata tagging, and **Dataplex** for lineage and quality controls.
